# CryptoGram
A simple encrypted chat application for the UTU course "Soveltuva projekti 2019"

## Startup
### Server
Start the CryptoGram server within a terminal or command line using the command
```
java -jar Server.jar [port]
```
where `port` is the wanted port number for the server to run on. The default port number, if no argument is given, is 1984.

### Client
Start the CryptoGram client either directly from a directory or from within a terminal or command line using the command
```
java -jar Client.jar
```

## Usage
To log in to the server from the client, enter the desired username, server address, and server port number. **NOTE:** If the username is taken, a variant will be automatically generated by appending a number to its end.

The client recognises the following commands:
- `/help`: list available chat commands
- `/list`: list all clients connected to the server who are not currently in a conversation
- `/join <username>`: start a conversation with the specified user if they are available
- `/leave`: leave the current conversation
- `/quit`: close the application
